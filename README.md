# Renewable Energy CAPEX & Risk Model

## Overview
This repository contains a modular financial model designed to evaluate the profitability of large-scale renewable energy integrations. Drawing on historical data from Southern Company ($43B+ CAPEX portfolio), the model identifies how construction overruns and interest rate shifts impact project viability.

## Key Features
* **LCOE & NPV Engine:** Calculates the Levelized Cost of Energy and Net Present Value over a 30-year asset lifecycle.
* **Sensitivity Analysis:** Features a "Scenario Engine" that stress-tests the model against 0-20% CAPEX overruns.
* **Operational Forecasting:** Incorporates annual degradation rates (0.5%) and interest during construction (IDC).
